# SCSS-Personal-Site-Template

Built using a framework provided from Cheetah Academy's Udemy Course - https://www.udemy.com/share/107ZjU3@UEXB_RuBJX5SPLHvj_40ojGHz6mskGEw3UjKA4YIPl78Vd4iD9YZmQW-Y_u0Tqqy/

All images came from the course material but looking at the sources they seem to be sourced from Pexels.com

I am not monetising this and will eventually be updating it to be personal to myself.
